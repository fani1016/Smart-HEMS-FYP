Smart Home Energy Monitoring System - Final Year Project

Energy is a concerned matter across the globe. As excessive energy consumption can be harmful for environment and can cost next generation with no to very few energy resources, so we need to be careful while consuming energy. This can be achieved by monitoring and being aware of how much energy is being utilized on daily or monthly basis. So our focus is to monitor energy being consumed by our appliances which we normally use in our daily lives. The system uses wireless (Bluetooth) communication and displays the information on an LCD screen as well as on the mobile application.
